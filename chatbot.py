    "what is air quality index": "The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a scale that measures the level of pollution in the air.",
    "how is aqi calculated": "AQI is calculated based on concentrations of major pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3.",
    "which city has the worst air quality": "The city with the worst air quality is determined by the highest AQI value in the dataset.",
    "what are the effects of bad air quality": "Bad air quality can cause respiratory issues, heart disease, and other health problems.",
    "how can we improve air quality": "Air quality can be improved by reducing vehicle emissions, using renewable energy, and planting more trees.",
    "what is the safe level of pm2.5": "The WHO guideline suggests PM2.5 should not exceed 15 Âµg/mÂ³ annually and 25 Âµg/mÂ³ daily.",
    "what is the safest city in terms of air pollution": "The safest city is the one with the lowest average AQI in the dataset.",
    "what are the major pollutants in air": "The major pollutants include PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3.",
    "how does weather affect air quality": "Weather factors such as temperature, wind, and humidity influence pollutant dispersion.",
    "how to check air quality in my area": "Use government monitoring websites, mobile apps, or real-time sensors.",
    "what are the main causes of air pollution": "Air pollution is caused by industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, deforestation, and wildfires.",
    "how does air pollution affect human health": "Long-term exposure to air pollution can cause respiratory diseases, heart problems, and even cancer.",
    "how can i reduce indoor air pollution": "Use air purifiers, improve ventilation, avoid smoking indoors, and keep air-purifying plants.",
    "what is the impact of electric vehicles on air pollution": "Electric vehicles reduce emissions and improve air quality compared to gasoline and diesel cars.",
    "what are the effects of pm2.5 on health": "PM2.5 can penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.",
    "which country has the worst air pollution": "The worst air pollution levels are often found in countries with high industrial activity and poor regulations.",
    "what is acid rain and how is it related to air pollution": "Acid rain is caused by SO2 and NO2 emissions reacting with water, leading to environmental damage.",
    "how does public transport help reduce air pollution": "Public transport reduces individual car use, leading to lower emissions and less congestion.",
    "what role do forests play in air quality": "Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 and filtering pollutants from the air.",
    "how does air pollution contribute to climate change": "Air pollution releases greenhouse gases like CO2, which trap heat and contribute to global warming.",
    "how do wildfires impact air quality": "Wildfires release large amounts of PM2.5, CO, and VOCs, leading to hazardous air quality.",
    "what are the different aqi categories": "AQI categories range from Good (0-50) to Hazardous (300+), indicating different levels of health risk.",
